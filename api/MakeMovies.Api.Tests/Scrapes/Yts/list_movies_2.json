Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson), two hit men working for mob kingpin Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames'), are sent to retrieve a very special and very mysterious briefcase for their boss. Vincent later must also show Mrs. Wallace (Uma Thurman) a good time while her husband is out. Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) is an aging prizefighter who is being paid to \"take a dive\", but instead accidentally kills his opponent, and tries to flee town, but not before getting his dead father's lucky golden watch.
