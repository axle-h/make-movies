Andy's favourite toy is a cowboy doll named Woody, who often acts as the leader or \"man with a plan\" for the other toys. During an early birthday celebration, Andy receives an action figure of the famous Buzz Lightyear. However, trouble arises when this new toy begins attracting the attention of not just Andy, but the other toys as well; making Woody jealous. Things get way out of hand when both Woody and Buzz are snatched away from Andy and end up in the hands of his maniacal neighbour. Together, the two toys must set aside their differences and escape.\u2014Affan Jamsari",
